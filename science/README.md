# Academic overview

I have a PhD from University of Heidelberg, and worked as a researcher for six years before leaving academia to work as a developer.
Currently I work as a data scientist and tech lead in the workers cooperative [Col·lectivaT][coop].
For more details you can take a look at my [CV](/assets/bkulebi_cv_en.pdf).

## Computational Linguistics
Part of my work in [Col·lectivat](https://collectivat.cat) is to make speech technologies more accessible to both developers and common public.
With the support of the Catalan Government (Generalitat), we have created a large speech corpus of Catalan, of more than 520 hourse, scraping it from publicly available sources. All the data, language models and acoustic models are available for download with open licences in our [website](https://collectivat.cat/asr).

## Astrophysics

During my time in academia, my main topic of interest was stellar evolution and stellar atmospheres.
I specialized on the Magnetic White Dwarfs and any physical process related to both their atmospheres and physical structure.
I was mostly interested on the strength and geometry of the magnetic fields on their surfaces and how they have came to be.

White Dwarfs in general are important for studies of stellar evolution because they are one of the final stages of the life cycle of stars, specifically stars like our Sun.
Their exotic, magnetic subtypes are of interest for understanding the complex fluid processes (such as convection) which the stars undergo throughout their life.
