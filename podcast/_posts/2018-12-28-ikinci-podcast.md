This is a post with certain styling.

### Styling

Normally in these posts it is suggested to separate like these

* Complete Jekyll setup included (layouts, config, [404]({{ '/404' | relative_url }}), [RSS feed]({{'/feed.xml' | relative_url }}){:.external}, posts, and [example page]({{ '/about/' | relative_url }}))
* Mobile friendly design and development
* Easily scalable text and component sizing with `rem` units in the CSS
* Support for a wide gamut of HTML elements
* Related posts (time-based, because Jekyll) below each post
* Syntax highlighting, courtesy Pygments (the Python-based code snippet highlighter)
